    INTELLIGENT AGENTS: A MODERN APPROACH
    
    Chapter 1: Introduction to Agents
    Agents are systems that perceive their environment and act upon it. An agent structure includes sensors, actuators, and the agent program.
    Rational agents strive to maximize their performance measure.
    
    Chapter 2: Problem Solving
    Problem solving agents use search algorithms to find sequences of actions that reach a goal.
    Uninformed search strategies (BFS, DFS) have no info about cost to goal.
    Informed search (A*, Greedy) use heuristics.
    
    Chapter 3: Knowledge Representation
    Logic is the primary vehicle for representing knowledge. Propositional logic is simple but limited. First-order logic allows objects and relations.
    Ontologies categorize the world.
    
    Chapter 4: Planning
    Planning agents use specific representations of states and actions. PDDL is a common language.
    Partial order planning vs Total order planning.
    
    Chapter 5: Artificial Neural Networks
    Perceptrons are the basic building blocks. Multi-layer perceptrons can approximate any function.
    Backpropagation is the key learning algorithm.
    Deep learning revolution changed the landscape with CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers.
    
    Chapter 6: Impact on Society
    AI safety, ethics, and bias are critical modern concerns.
    Automation and the workforce.
